# FPU

Floating point operations are widely used in large set of scientific and signal processing computation. IEEE has set a standard for these operations numbered IEEE-754. In this project, a floating point arithmetic operation unit need to be developed and tested according to IEEE specifications. This unit is a combination of a control logic and data path. The operations need to be done on single and double precision floating point numbers.
